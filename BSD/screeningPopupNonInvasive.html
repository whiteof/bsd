        <h2>Non-Invasive Breast Cancers</h2>
        <p>
            Some breast cancers grow within the ducts and lobules of the breast without invading into the surrounding breast tissue or spreading to other parts of the body. These are called DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) and LCIS (Lobular carcinoma in situ). Some people call DCIS and LCIS "Stage 0 breast cancer".
        </p>
        <p>
            While some cases of DCIS and LCIS will progress to invasive cancer, others are slow-growing and may never become invasive during a woman's lifetime. Unfortunately, doctors cannot predict with certainty which DCIS and LCIS will become invasive cancers and which will not. Therefore, most cases of DCIS and LCIS are treated as if they were invasive breast cancer. That treatment can include surgery, radiation and/or hormonal therapy.
