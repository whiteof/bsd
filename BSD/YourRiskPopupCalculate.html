        <h2>How Did We Calculate Your Risk?</h2>

        <p>
            We calculated your risk of developing breast cancer using a mathematical formula known as the Gail model. This formula uses information about a woman's medical history, reproductive history and family history of breast cancer to estimate her own personal risk of developing invasive breast cancer over specific periods of time. The Gail model has been tested in large populations of white women and has been shown to provide accurate estimates of breast cancer risk. It has been shown to perform well in African-American women, but may slightly underestimate their breast cancer risk, especially if they have a history of breast biopsies. The model has been validated for Asian and Pacific Islander women. It has not yet been validated in Hispanic women.
