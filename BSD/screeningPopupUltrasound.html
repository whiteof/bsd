        <h2>Breast Ultrasound</h2>
        <p>
            Ultrasound uses sound waves to visualize the breast tissue. Alone, ultrasound images, also known as sonograms, are not effective tools for routine breast cancer screening due to high rates of both false-negative and false-positive results. However, sonograms are useful in evaluating abnormalities found on screening mammography, and to visualize cysts and other benign masses in the breast. Sonograms are also used to evaluate breast symptoms and masses in younger women, whose breast density may limit visibility on mammography.
