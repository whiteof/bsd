        <h2>How well do mammograms perform in women like me?</h2>
        <p>
            No one can predict exactly what your individual mammogram results will be. Here is how mammograms perform in women ages 40-49 who are at low to average risk of breast cancer.

        <h3>So What Does This Mean?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Almost all women your age will have a normal mammogram.</strong></li>
            <li>
                <strong>Almost all abnormal mammograms are not cancer.</strong>
                These are <a href="screeningPopupFalsePositive.html">false-positive</a> results. The more often you get screened, the greater your chance of ever having a false-positive result. Over 10 years, women who have mammograms every year have a 60% chance of a false-positive result. Women who have mammograms every other year have a 40% chance of a false-positive result.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Some breast cancers may be missed.</strong>
                These are <a href="screeningPopupFalseNegative.html">false-negative</a> results. When a cancer is missed by a screening mammogram, it is usually found after a woman has <a href="http://bsd.med.cornell.edu/bsd-info.html#signs-and-symptoms">symptoms</a> or at a future screening mammogram visit.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>By catching some cancers early, before a woman has symptoms, mammograms can reduce the chance of dying from breast cancer. Let's see how.</p>
