        <h2>Risk Of Harm</h2>
        <p>
            The chance of a mammogram actually increasing breast cancer risk due to radiation exposure is extremely low, and is not a cause of concern in routine screening. However, exposure of the developing breast to radiation is a concern, and this is one of the reasons we do not recommend routine screening mammograms in women under age 40, in addition to the fact that cancers are rare in this age group. Cumulative radiation exposure may also be a consideration in high-risk women who start screening early and have repeated mammograms over many years.
