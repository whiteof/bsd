</p>
<p>
    A <strong>screening mammogram</strong> is an x-ray that looks for breast cancer in a healthy woman who has no
    <a href="screeningPopupSings.html">signs or symptoms</a>
    of breast cancer.
</p>
<p>
    Screening mammograms do not prevent breast cancer. Their purpose is to detect breast cancer before it is large enough to be felt or cause symptoms. If you have any breast symptoms, you should see your doctor.

<p>
    A <strong>diagnostic mammogram</strong> is performed when a woman feels a lump or has breast symptoms or if her screening mammogram is abnormal.
