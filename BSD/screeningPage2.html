<p><strong>There are benefits and harms of screening mammograms for women at any age.</strong></p>

<h3>Benefits of screening mammograms</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Mammograms reduce the chance of dying from breast cancer.</strong> By finding breast cancer at an early stage, mammograms allow for early cancer treatment that can increase the chance of a cure.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Mammograms are more effective in older than younger women. Women in their 40's tend to have
                <a href="screeningPopupDenser.html">denser breasts</a>,
                making it more difficult to find breast cancers in women in this age group compared to older women.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mammograms do not prevent all breast cancer deaths. Some fast-growing breast cancers may have already spread to other parts of the body by the time they are found by a mammogram.

<h3>Possible harms of screening mammograms</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>False-positive results.</strong> A false-positive result occurs when a mammogram is abnormal but there is no cancer. An abnormal mammogram usually requires additional imaging (
        <a href="screeningPopupDiagnostic.html">diagnostic mammogram</a>,
        <a href="screeningPopupUltrasound.html">ultrasound</a> or
        <a href="screeningPopupMri.html">MRI</a>) and possibly a
        <a href="screeningPopupBiopsy.html">breast biopsy</a>.
        If an abnormal mammogram is not cancer, this additional testing may seem unnecessary, inconvenient and physically uncomfortable.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Overdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment.</strong> Screening mammograms often find slow-growing breast cancers and
        <a href="screeningPopupNonInvasive.html">non-invasive</a> breast cancers. These cancers have a very small chance of causing death, so treating them - with surgery, chemotherapy and radiation - may seem unnecessary. However, it is very difficult to predict whether a cancer will be life-threatening, so almost all cancers that are found will be treated.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>False-negative results.</strong> A false-negative result occurs when a mammogram is normal but a woman truly has breast cancer. Mammograms are not perfect. Some breast cancers will be missed by screening.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Radiation exposure.</strong> Mammograms use radiation, but the
        <a href="screeningPopupHarm.html">risk of harm</a> from screening mammograms is extremely low.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    It's hard to know who will benefit from mammograms and who will experience harm. What we can tell you is how mammograms perform in women like you and how starting screening at different ages may affect a woman's chance of dying from breast cancer.
