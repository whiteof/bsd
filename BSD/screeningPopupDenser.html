        <h2>Breast Density</h2>
        <p>
            Breast density refers to the amount of breast tissue in a given area of the breast as seen on mammography. Breasts that are very dense appear white on mammography, making cancers harder to see. In addition, women with very dense breasts have a slightly higher risk of developing breast cancer compared to women with low breast density.
