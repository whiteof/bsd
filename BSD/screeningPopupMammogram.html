        <h2>What Is It Like To Get A Mammogram?</h2>
        <p>
            You will be asked to undress from the waist up. An x-ray technician will escort you to the mammogram machine. While you are standing, the technician will place your breasts, one at a time, between two plates - an x-ray plate and a plastic plate. These plates are used to flatten the breast tissue so that the image will be of good quality. This may feel uncomfortable, and for some women, painful - but it will only take a few seconds. Usually, two x-rays are taken of each breast from different angles. Having a mammogram takes about 20 minutes.
